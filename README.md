# Python Orbit Lab 

In Python Orbit lab, you can build your own space program while learning
about the Physics of spaceflight. We will use Pygame to create interactive
simulations of planets and rockets, while learning about gravity, force, aceleration
and other physics concepts. 

The prerequisite for this class is the 
 [Python Games](https://github.com/league-curriculum/Python-Games) class, where you will 
 learn the basics of vectors, velocity, acceleration and forces.
