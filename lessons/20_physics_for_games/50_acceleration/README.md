# Spring Force Acceleration

This program demonstrated force and acelleration using a spring, represented by
a blue line. The spring is attached between the red square and the green fixed
point, and it applies a for to the red box that pushes it back to the center of the screen. 

The force equation for this system is know as Hookes Law: 

$$
F = -k x
$$

where:
- $F$ is the force exerted by the spring,
- $k$ is the spring constant,
- $x$ is the displacement from the equilibrium position.

This equation means that when you stretch a spring or a rubber band, the force
points in the opposite direction that you stretched it. 

## Assignment

Update the program to include a y direction that operates just like the x direction.
