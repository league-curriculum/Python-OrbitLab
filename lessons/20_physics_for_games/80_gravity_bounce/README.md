# Gravity Bounce

For this optional assignment, update the program to give the ball a boost. 

In this program , a ball is bouncing off walls and the floor, with a paddle
at the bottom that you can move left and right. 

## Assignment

1. When the ball collides with the paddle, give the paddle a boost in velocity.
  You might want to limit the velocity to 25 so the ball doesn't go too far off
  the screen. 
2. Make the paddle fly with the up arrow and down arrows, which produce some
"thrust", a small change in velocity. 
3. Add gravity to your flying paddle, with gravity slowly pulling the paddle back down.
