# Draw a square with Vectors. 

For this assignment we will be using our own vector class, `Vector20` which is
based on `Vector2`, but has extensions for plotting a grid with numbers and
labels. Use it just like you would a `Vector2`

1. Open and read `Vector Example` and run the program.
2. Create vector v1 with x = 0 and y = 1 
3. Scale the vector by 10 with multiplication, then rotate it by 90 degrees so
   it points to the right.
4. Draw the vector from the position (5,5) on the grid.
5. Create a new vector v2 by rotating v1 by 90 dregrees, and draw it from the
   ending position of v1 ( which is the return value from the draw_v20()
   function )
6. Continue rotating and drawing until you have drawn a square.
